Ravencoin Development meeting 3-26-21

Old Business
Which non-code things should the Foundation control and spend money on? Seeds? Websites?
Can someone put together a list of all the major Ravencoin-related websites & github accounts and who owns them or has control?
What about social media accounts (Discord, Telegram, Reddit, etc) and who owns, controls, moderates them?
Post them on the Foundation website
The point of the exercise is transparency, not to gain control.
Should we fund someone a modest amount to go through the Discord helpdesk and put together & maintain an organized FAQ for noobs?
Should we fund someone a modest amount to keep Raven.wiki updated?
Updates on existing core development work
Update on #880 - Sweep capability for RVN core
